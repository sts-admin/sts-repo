## ui-listView
An Angular directive for an efficient, dynamically changing list.  It's able to handle data sets with thousands of
items while providing a similar interface to ng-repeat.  Unlike other variations, row heights are based
on the row content, and the list view dynamically updates to accommodate changes.

This is an initial release.  More features and testing are in the works.

## Installation

You can use bower to install ui-listView.

```
bower install ui-listView
```

Then include the "ui-listView" module into your angular application.

```
var appModule = angular.module("app", [ui-listView])
```

## Code Example

See live code examples on http://stevenlambion.github.io/ui-listView/

```
<div class="contact-list" ui-list-view="contact in contacts" options="listOptions">
    <p class="name"><strong>{{ contact.name }}</strong></p>
    <div class="email">{{ contact.email }}</div>
</div>
```

## Motivation

Working on many projects that required large or paged lists lead me to create this directive.  I wanted something with a simple interface like ng-repeat,
yet able to handle big data sets.  There was also a strong need for dynamic rows.  However, above all, I did this because it sounded like a fun problem to solve. 

## API

### options
type: `Object`

Configuration options for the list view.  You can provide the options to the directive with an "options" attribute as shown in the example above.

#### options.preferredHeight
type: `Number`
default: `48`

This is the initial preferred, or estimated, height of a row. 
Once a row is displayed, it'll use its content as the height and update the list view as it changes.

#### options.listView
type: `Object`

This property is added by the list view to provide API access.  Documentation is coming shortly.

#### options.range
type: `Object`

A read-only property that shows the current visible range of items being displayed.  It can be useful to indicate when to load more items
from a service when implementing infinite scroll.

## Styles
Use the following CSS classes on the ui-listView's element to set built-in styles, or use your own CSS classes for a custom style.

#### ui-list-view-bordered
Wraps the ui-listView and its cells in a border.

#### ui-list-view-striped
Adds a striped appearance to the cells.
